Create a proper documentation folder in the repository to guide new learners on how to use Doglang in its current state. The documentation should include:

- An introduction to the language
- Installation and setup instructions

- Language features overview
- Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

**Tasks:**
- Add a `/docs` folder and populate it with relevant documentation files.
- Add links to the docs folder in the main repository README.
- Invite feedback and contributions to the documentation.

**Benefits:**
- Makes it easier for new learners to get started
- Improves onboarding for contributors
- Centralizes language resources
