# Contributing to Doglang Documentation

Thank you for your interest in improving Doglang! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether you are fixing typos, clarifying explanations, or adding new sections.

Here‚Äôs how you can help:

---

## Editing Documentation

All documentation files are Markdown (`.md`) files located inside the `/docs` folder in the repository.

- To make changes, simply edit the relevant `.md` files.
- You can add new files or update existing ones to improve clarity, add examples, or fix mistakes.

## Previewing Documentation Locally

Before submitting your changes, it‚Äôs a good idea to preview how the documentation will look on the website.

1. Install MkDocs if you haven‚Äôt already:
```bash
pip install mkdocs
```

2. From the project root directory, run:
```bash
mkdocs serve
```

3. Open your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to see a live preview.

When you save your Markdown files, the preview will update automatically.

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the Doglang repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a branch for your changes (e.g., `improve-docs`).
3. Make your edits and commit them with clear messages.
4. Push your branch to your fork.
5. Open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the original repository‚Äôs `main` branch.

We review all pull requests promptly and provide feedback if necessary.
