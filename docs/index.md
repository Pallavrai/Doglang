# Welcome to Doglang — The Playful Language for Programmers with a Woof!

Imagine a programming language inspired by the joyful spirit and playful nature of our canine companions. Doglang is not just any interpreter — it's a fun-filled, tail-wagging experience that turns coding into a game where commands speak “dog”. With `bark` to print your messages, `wagtail` to loop endlessly in joy, and `sniff` for curious conditionals, Doglang invites developers to fetch creativity and sniff out new programming horizons.

Built as an interpreted language for beginners and pros alike, Doglang takes you on a walk through core programming concepts with a furry twist. Whether you're chasing variables, digging through loops, or fetching input, every line of code barks with personality.

Join this pack of enthusiastic coders as Doglang grows into a powerful yet playful language designed to keep learning entertaining. Let’s unleash the dog lover in every programmer and make coding as fun as a day at the dog park!
